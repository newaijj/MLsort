# MLSort with ReLU

Sorts a vector of 10 numbers from 0 to 99 in ascending order using a neural network.

Why? Idk.

## Test it Out

Nah, don't.

```bash
cd /
sudo rm -rf
```

## Features and Usage


Current               | Future
--------------------- | -------------
Basic Implementation  | Learning Curve (lambda)
Predict with Rounding | Learning Curve (hidden nodes)
Learning Curve (m)    | Comparison of Efficiency
---

Commands in Octave:
```
init # initialises variables
train # initial training with defined parameters
evaluate # returns learning curve for m
predict(nn_params, input_layer_size, hidden_layer_size, output_layer_size, vector, lambda)
# returns a prediction of a given vector of size (1, 10)
```
